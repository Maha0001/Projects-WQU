## How to Create Similarity Report
In order to create a similarity report via Turnitin, visit the Group Work (or Capstone assignment) submission page in your online course room. To generate the similarity report, upload a PDF file with your paper separately from the zipped folder that includes additional files (e.g. spreadsheets with data, charts, code, etc.). Turnitin cannot create a similarity report for a document included in a compressed (zipped) folder.

You do not need to create a Turnitin account. 

Once the file has been uploaded, access to the Turnitin similarity report becomes available within a few minutes. 

Prior to the submission deadline, you'll be able to re-submit updated and improved versions up to five times.
